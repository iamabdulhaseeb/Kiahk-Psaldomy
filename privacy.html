  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 11/20/2025</p>

  <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
  <p>At Kiahk Psaldomy, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.</p>

  <h2>No Personal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users of Kiahk Psaldomy. The app operates entirely on your device without requiring account creation, login credentials, or any form of user registration.</p>

  <h2>Offline Operation</h2>
  <p>Kiahk Psaldomy requires an initial internet connection to download all PDF content to your device. Once the PDFs are downloaded, the app works completely offline. All content is stored locally on your device, and after the initial download, the app does not require an internet connection to function. This means your reading activity, preferences, and any data remain private and secure on your device.</p>

  <h2>Optional Feedback</h2>
  <p>If you choose to submit feedback, bug reports, or feature requests through the app, you may provide your email address voluntarily. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry and is not stored in any database or used for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>No Tracking or Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not use any tracking technologies, analytics services, or third-party data collection tools. We do not monitor your app usage, reading habits, or any other activity within the app.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Kiahk Psaldomy does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. The app is self-contained and operates independently.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is suitable for users of all ages. Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not have any data about children to protect. However, we are committed to maintaining the same privacy standards for all users regardless of age.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
